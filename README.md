# finra-filter

Download finra data and filter through seemingly useless data for personal use.
The output files comes in both `xlsx` and `csv`.

## About the project

This data was shown to me and proved to be very promising in my investing journey.
There's originally over 9000 different securities in the file and with my script
we're able to reduce it to around 800-900 depending on the day.

## Experiences this project gave me:

- Dealing with the pandas and BeautifulSoup libraries
- Scraping websites for useful information
- CSV files

###### (Many more features can be added to this script like randomly picking a stock, having the most popular stocks listed first in it's own section, changing the order that the stocks are listed, etc., but I currently have other things I need to be focused on.)
